Steps to Rebuild and Run:
Clean the Build:

sh
Copy code
go clean -modcache
Rebuild the Plugin:

sh
Copy code
go build -buildmode=plugin -o patterns/my_pattern.so my_pattern.go
Rebuild the Main Application:

sh
Copy code
go build -o syslog-converter main.go
Run the Main Application:

sh
Copy code
./syslog-converter
Verification:
You can use the tail -f command to continuously monitor the log file:

sh
Copy code
tail -n 0 -f filterlog.log
This configuration ensures that the log_timestamp field matches the expected input format for Logstash and is correctly named for parsing. This should make the logs easily readable and parsable by Logstash.
